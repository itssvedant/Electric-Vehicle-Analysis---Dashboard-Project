Electric Vehicle Analysis - Dashboard Project


Tools Used: Power BI | Tableau

ðŸ“Š Project Overview:
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption across different U.S. states, focusing on model year trends, manufacturers, and vehicle types. It is built using two leading data visualization toolsâ€”Power BI and Tableauâ€”to explore EV data from multiple angles and provide interactive, real-time insights.

âœ… Objective:
ðŸ”¹To analyze and visualize electric vehicle adoption trends.

ðŸ”¹To compare BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) vs. PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) distribution.

ðŸ”¹To identify the most popular makes, models, and states for EVs.

ðŸ”¹To study Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility status.

ðŸ”¹To compare model years in relation to total vehicle count and range.

ðŸ”¹To demonstrate skills in creating compelling and interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights:
ðŸ”¹ Power BI Dashboard Highlights:
Total Vehicles Analyzed: 150.42K

Average Electric Range: 67.83 miles

Vehicle Types:

BEVs: 117K (78%)

PHEVs: 34K (22%)

Top Manufacturers:

Tesla (69K), Nissan (13K), Chevrolet (12K)

Popular Models:

Model Y (29K), Model 3 (28K), Leaf (13K)

Model Year Trend: Steady growth from 2011 to a peak in 2023 (37K vehicles), then a drop in 2024 (1K).

CAFV Eligibility:

Eligible: 46.33%

Unknown: 41.81%

Not Eligible: 11.86%

Geographical Analysis: High adoption in Washington, California, and Eastern states.

ðŸ”¹ Tableau Dashboard Highlights:
Total Vehicles Analyzed: 130.8K

Average Electric Range: 73.10 miles

Vehicle Types:

BEVs: 104.8K (80.2%)

PHEVs: 25.9K (19.8%)

Top Manufacturers:

Tesla (68.9K), Nissan (13.5K), Chevrolet (12K)

Popular Models:

Model Y (28.5K), Model 3 (27.7K), Leaf (13.1K), Bolt EV, Model S

Model Year Trend: Growth from 2011â€“2023 (peak in 2023 with 30.4K), slight drop in 2024.

CAFV Eligibility:

Eligible: 42.75%

ðŸ“Œ Insights :
ðŸ”¹ EV Growth Over Time:
Both dashboards show a sharp increase in EV adoption between 2017 and 2023, peaking in 2023 with 37K vehicles (Power BI) and 30.4K vehicles (Tableau).

A notable drop in 2024 suggests incomplete data or a lag in reporting for the most recent year.

ðŸ”¹ BEV vs. PHEV Distribution:
Power BI: BEVs make up 78% (117K), PHEVs 22% (34K).

Tableau: Slightly higher BEV share at 80.2% (104.8K), with PHEVs at 19.8% (25.9K).

BEVs dominate across both tools, indicating a strong consumer shift toward fully electric vehicles.

ðŸ”¹ Top EV Manufacturers:
Tesla is the unquestioned market leader, contributing over 50% of total EVs in both dashboards (69K in Power BI, ~68.9K in Tableau).

Nissan and Chevrolet follow, each holding under 11% market share.

ðŸ”¹ Most Popular Models:
Teslaâ€™s Model Y and Model 3 are the top two models in both dashboards, with a near-equal share (~28Kâ€“29K each).

Other significant models: Nissan Leaf, Chevy Bolt EV, Tesla Model S.

ðŸ”¹ CAFV Eligibility Distribution:
Large portion of vehicles have unknown eligibility (~46% in both tools), which may point to incomplete regulatory tagging.

CAFV-eligible vehicles account for around 42â€“46%, indicating moderate policy coverage.

ðŸ”¹ Geographic Concentration:
EV ownership is heavily concentrated in coastal and urban states, especially Washington, California, Georgia, and New York.

Some central states show minimal adoption, suggesting room for infrastructure or incentive development.

Unknown: 46.33%

Not Eligible: 10.92%

State-wise Analysis: Clear visualization of EV distribution, especially concentrated in coastal states.

ðŸš€ Conclusion:
This dual-dashboard project offers a clear and actionable view of how EV adoption is unfolding across the U.S. It highlights key trends in model popularity, manufacturer dominance, and policy participation. By leveraging both Power BI and Tableau, this project showcases analytical flexibility and strong visualization designâ€”ideal for business analysts, sustainability teams, or policymakers looking to extract value from transportation data.
